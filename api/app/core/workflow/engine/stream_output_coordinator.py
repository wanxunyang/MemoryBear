                Completion status of the control branch node.

        1. Force activation:
           - If `self.force` is True, the method returns immediately.

               - `activate = True`
               - `force = True`
             This is typically used for final flushing when the node finishes execution.

           - If `scope` matches a key in `control_nodes`:
               - `status` must be provided.
               - If `status` matches expected branch labels, mark control as resolved

           - If `scope` is in `upstream_output_nodes`,
             mark data dependency as resolved (`output_resolved = True`).

        4. Global activation condition:
           - The node becomes active when BOTH conditions are satisfied:
               - control_resolved == True
               - output_resolved == True
           - Once activated, `activate` remains True.

        5. Variable segment activation:
           - For each output segment that is a variable (`is_variable=True`):
               - If the segment depends on the given `scope`,
                 mark the segment as active.
           - This applies to both node variables (e.g., "node_id.field")
             and system variables (e.g., "sys.xxx").

        Notes:
        - This method does NOT emit output or advance the streaming cursor.
        - It only updates activation and dependency resolution states.
